2. Speed
IaC allows faster execution when configuring infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. 

3. Reduced risk 
Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability. 

4. Test
Infrastructure as Code enables DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early in the development cycle.

5. Stable and scalable environments
IaC delivers stable environments rapidly and at scale. Teams avoid manual configuration of environments and enforce consistency by representing the desired state of 
their environments via code. Infrastructure deployments with IaC are repeatable and prevent runtime issues caused by configuration drift or missing dependencies. 
DevOps teams can work together with a unified set of practices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly, reliably, and at scale.

6. Accountability
Since you can version IaC configuration files like any source code file, you have full traceability of the changes each configuration suffered. 

7. Configuration consistency
IaC completely standardizes the setup of infrastructure so there is reduced possibility of any errors or deviations.
This will decrease the chances of any incompatibility issues with your infrastructure and help your applications run more smoothly.

8. Documentation
Not only does IaC automate the process, but it also serves as a form of documentation of the proper way to instantiate infrastructure and insurance in the case where employees leave your company with institutional knowledge. Because code can be version-controlled, IaC allows every change to your server configuration to be documented, logged, and tracked. And these configurations can be tested, just like code.

9. Enhanced security
If all compute, storage, and networking services are provisioned with code, then they are deployed the same way every time. 
This means that security standards can be easily and consistently deployed across company without having to have a security gatekeeper review and approve every change.

Infrastructure as Code tools
There are many tools that can help you automate your infrastructure, but letâ€™s look at the most popular and successful ones: 

1. Terraform
Terraform is a declarative provisioning and infrastructure orchestration tool that lets engineers automate provisioning of all aspects of their enterprise cloud-based and on-premises infrastructure. (You can read more about it in our previous post about Terraform)

4. Ansible
Ansible is an infrastructure automation tool created by Red Hat. Ansible models your infrastructure by describing how your components and system relate to one another, as opposed to managing systems independently.

2. Chef
Chef is one of the most popular configuration management tools that organizations use in their continuous integration and delivery processes. Chef is cloud-agnostic and works with many cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, and more.

3. Puppet
Puppet is another popular configuration management tool that helps engineers continuously deliver software. Using Puppet, you can define the desired end state of your infrastructure and exactly what you want it to do. Then Puppet automatically enforces the desired state and fixes any incorrect changes. Puppet integrates with the leading cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and VMware, allowing you to automate across multiple clouds.



Infrastructure as Code can simplify and accelerate your infrastructure provisioning process, help you avoid mistakes and comply with policies, 
keep your environments consistent, and save your company a lot of time and money.
